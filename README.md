# CloudCherry SSO through Active Directory

Large businesses can enable Role based SSO(Single Sign On) for their users who are already authenticated by their intranet/website or email system or software such as CMS/ERP/CRM/PoS; SSO prevents duplication of effort to create and maintain open hundreds of username/password profiles for large businesses with many employees. 

SSO works by building a information packet(JSON) with the authenticated userâ€™s information and then encrypting the packet to obtain a SSO token that can be passed on to CloudCherry API for automatic login.

#### What is happening when you run the MVC App?

[API Tech whitepaper - Page 29](https://contentcdn.azureedge.net/assets/CherryAPITechnologyWhitepaper.pdf) and [Sample code](https://www.getcloudcherry.com/api/) is here.

On Successful Authentication from your AD, you will be presented with a Web Page. By clicking on ***Login to CloudCherry*** SSOToken will be created and you would be redirected to CloudCherry Insight Centre along with SSOToken and account name ( "https://cx.getcloudcherry.com/#/login?sso=<accountName>&ssotoken=<token>").

#### Where is the code for SSOToken Generation?

You can find it [here](https://github.com/Femilshajin/CloudCherry-SSO-Active-Directory/blob/master/CloudCherrySSO/Helpers/SSOHelper.cs).

#### How to use an On-Premise Identity Server and Connect to CloudCherry?

It's almost as similar as previous steps, [this blog](http://work.haufegroup.io/haufe-adfs-identity-for-aspnet-login/) explains it much better.
